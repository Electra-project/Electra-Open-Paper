# **Abstract**

Electra is an open-source community cryptocurrency project featuring decentralized and distributed governance. Electra's foundation is a blockchain based on the NIST5 algorithm, guaranteeing fast and secure transactions with nearly non-existent transaction costs.

Electra's goal is to become the electric current of the cryptocurrency community. Our vision is to advance the evolution of our economic system as originally proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Electra is a unique cryptocurrency in that it is both a development project and a contract. Despite being a fully operational cryptocurrency at present, Electra is an ongoing development project subject to review, innovation, and updating. Electra is also a contract in that it offers the investor full participation in the development process, including but not limited to the following. 

 * Access to Electra community
 * The right to obtain project information
 * Involvement in  development decisions
 * Comprehensive voting rights
 * Access to technical support

The Electra Blockchain and the ECA coin is a product of the combined skills and abilities of an ever-growing community of coders, developers, business professionals and other contributors. ECA is built on a fully functional and feature rich blockchain with a stable and solid foundation. This foundation provides the reliable platform needed for our talented community of developers to innovate, invent and build upon. Blockchain technology evolves on a daily basis. As this technology improves, ECA's foundation will expand and grow in tandem with the latest innovations.

Digital currency was created to bring change to the financial world through the decentralisation and disintermediation of the global financial ecosystem. Progress towards this goal has thus far been inhibited by insufficient technical tools that alone are simply not enough to affect mass adoption of blockchain technology. Recent technological developments are only now beginning to  unlock new possibilities. These developments have resulted in paradigm shifts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem regarding the scalability, accessibility, speed, and cost of blockchain applications.

The opportunity for dramatic change within a developing ecosystem is unfortunately time limited. Newly developed systems evolve quickly, rapidly reaching a point where progressive and lasting change is inhibited by the structures built during each stage of the evolution. As blockchain technology moves towards structural boundaries within the ecosystem there is a period of time in which greater freedom of action for the evolutionary forces at work is possible. For cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a whole, that time is now. Electra is positioned to become one of the main driving forces of change while these windows of opportunity remain open. 

Participants within the traditional economic structure are attempting to employ old logic and adapt to the ongoing restructuring of our economic system, subverting the original intent behind the cryptocurrency movement. The need exists for the cryptocurrency community at large to recapture the original spirit behind decentralization and disintermediation. The Electra Project is an effective response to this need. ECA owners are no longer just investors in a cryptocurrency. Instead, by being directly involved in the decision making process, investors take part in the entire underlying structure: code innovation, design, marketing, community building, and strategic business development.

Through this process, participants within the economic system are no longer relegated to being mere consumers. Electra returns the power to the people, and assigns members of the community an active role in the evolution of our economic and monetary systems.

# Electrifying the Cryptocurrency Community

Electra is more than a common digital currency. It is a currency backed by an entire community of dedicated individuals. Electra’s goal is to create the strongest possible community of individuals who all share the same philosophy of change with regards to global monetary systems. Through transparency and empowerment, we are shining a new light on a darkening system. This is not a zero sum game; this is Electra.

Our vision for Electra is that it becomes the largest and most active cryptocurrency community within the market space. An active global community provides investors an opportunity to assume roles as active players and contributors. Electra is not only a decentralized organization, but a unique and powerful revolution based on shared ownership and collaboration among the skilled experts throughout our community.

## 
	Investor Benefit

ECA investors hold a stake in the Electra organization and are encouraged to become directly involved in the development process. All investors are owners of both the cryptocurrency and the entire structure that exists behind the project.

## Innovative and Open Development Process

The underlying architecture of the Electra Project is continuously subjected to multiple stages of validation. Through this process only the most valid and valuable changes are adopted and integrated. Any and all decisions are subject to review, update, and upgrade as needed. Even an optimal system has limits. Guarantees of reversibility and the highest level of quality are needed. Electra’s strength is its ability to adapt and consistently meet the needs of a changing global environment.

Building and deconstructing simultaneously is necessary to create the best possible product given the current limitations, and at the same time provide for the ability to further refine the product. In doing so we must accept the possibility that the existing product has room to improve or that the underlying factors of previous developments have changed. Our methodology allows for continuous evolution of the product within a changing environment. The resulting development will produce the best possible product at any given time.

## Electra Sets New Standards for Cryptocurrencies

The best product is the one capable of becoming completely different from its origins. Today, the leading cryptocurrencies on the market can only guarantee their relevance to investors for an ephemeral period. What is now at the forefront of the market will soon be outdated and outclassed by innovative competitors.

As a community we synthesize and condense the vision of many individuals, compare and contrast diverse viewpoints, and examine possible outcomes. The results of this process are subjected to rigorous review, which allows us to systematically detect probable errors by analyzing a multitude of viewpoints. This approach ensures that only the most valid ideas survive to reach implementation. To reach our goals it is necessary to widen the scope of discussion as much as possible and to extend an open dialogue indefinitely. 

The end result is the Electra Project.

The Electra Project’s primary points of focus are the following:

* Design and build the most cutting edge cryptocurrency

* Create a financial ecosystem for the community

* Ensure that the project is driven by community needs

* Evolve the product over time, utilizing best practices

# Current Technology

## The Algorithm

ECA is built using an algorithm that guarantees security; NIST5. NIST5  is an algorithm developed using the best features of the five SHA-3 finalist algorithms as selected by the National Institute of Science and Technology of America. In practice, the NIST5 algorithm as implemented in ECA selects the most beneficial attributes of each component algorithm to maximize performance, security, and efficiency. These component algorithms include:

* BLAKE

* Grostl

* JH

* Keccak

* Skein

** NIST Competition Summary   [http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf)    

** Handbook of Digital Currency Bitcoin Innovation, Financial Instruments and Big Data.pdf

## The Electra Blockchain

The underlying blockchain of the ECA coin utilizes a modified version of the NIST5 algorithm with the following properties:* *

* Block Size: 1MB

* Block Time: 5 minutes (288 blocks per day)

* Max Supply: 30,000,000,000

* Pre-mined: 1,000,000,019 (approximately 3.34%)

* Difficulty Target: Retarget occurs every 15 minutes (every 3 blocks)

* Fee: 0.00001 ECA

*
*Purpose and Use of Pre-mined ECA

1,000,000,019 (approximately 3.34%) ECA were pre-mined using Proof of Work (PoW) mining. Pre-mined funds are maintained by a trusted Community Funds Manager. Distribution and use of funds is determined by community consensus. Pre-mined funds will be used for various purposes including but not limited to the following:

* Maintaining the security and usability of the platform

* Funding further development projects as outlined by Electra Roadmap

* Application to new exchanges

## Fast Payments

ECA transactions are received in the recipient’s wallet almost instantly and the ECA received is spendable as soon as the transaction is confirmed in the blockchain. The confirmation process requires less than five minutes.

## Transaction Fees Approaching Zero

With transaction fees on the Electra network of 0.00001 ECA, it takes 100,000 transactions to accumulate one ECA worth of transaction fees (approximately $0.004 USD at time of this publication). This results in a cost per transaction of approximately $0.00000004.

## Staking Rewards

ECA features a 50% annual stake reward rate. There is no fixed reward per block. Each stake reward is proportional to the amount staked relative to the total ECA in circulation. Additional information regarding the Proof of Stake reward structure for ECA can be found at: 

* https://electraproject.org/crypto-wallet-staking-guide-electra-project

## Optional Privacy

Future developments within the Electra ecosystem will allow for the use of privacy gateways, including but not limited to the following.

* TOR

* IP2 networks 

* Kovri

Users will be able to select the privacy functions best suited to their individual needs. The Electra community is continually working to identify the most scalable and efficient gateway configurations to ensure privacy of transactions. 

## Environmentally Friendly

The NIST5 algorithm utilized by the ECA cryptocurrency is more environmentally friendly than competing technologies and has proven to be a sustainable option for deployment of blockchain-based systems. NIST5 requires significantly less energy to run than competing algorithms without compromising the security of network members. 

Furthermore, Electra does not have an extended Proof of Work (PoW) phase. Electra’s blockchain network is now Proof of Stake (PoS) which results in no miners and a greatly reduced carbon footprint.

# Future Technology

When you invest in ECA you become a stakeholder in a fully open source project aimed at developing the most cutting edge technology for the evolution of cryptocurrency. Investors who choose Electra will be a part of this journey. Current technology is a good starting point. However, creating the cryptocurrency of the future requires going beyond the limits of existing technology. 

The strength of ECA resides in the contract that guarantees investors full participation in the direction of the project, including all future developments and technologies. ECA’s potential growth is guaranteed because tomorrow's ECA will not be just another coin, but rather an adaptation to future societal and economic needs. Investors can be confident that when they purchase ECA, they are investing in the present and future growth of a unique cryptocurrency ecosystem.

If an algorithm emerges that is more efficient and superior to NIST5, Electra’s development team is prepared to adapt ECA's underlying structure to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. As Electra grows the block time can be reduced and the block size can be increased. The adaptability of ECA allows for the blockchain to be maintained while the algorithm is rewritten from scratch. In effect Electra is a blank paper for writing revolutionary code. Writing the code of the future on an already active codebase results in a deployed structure that neither obstructs, limits, nor hinders future development. ECA’s architecture allows a subsequent structure to intersect, connect, flank or replace the existing structure. Electra provides a better solution than existing currencies can and guarantees the community full control.

# Electra Ecosystem

In order for merchants to complete transactions, they need to be able to accept payments from consumers. In today’s world merchants do not have the proper technical tools at their disposal for accepting digital currency as a form of payment. Merchants that do accept digital currencies  are paying extremely high fees to do so.

Despite the proliferation of technology across the globe, many developing regions of the world continue to operate within a system where the ‘Cash is King’ philosophy remains dominant in conducting commerce. Ease of adoption provided by the Electra ecosystem combined with easy access to mobile Internet in developing countries provides a secure, fast, and low fee payment gateway for both consumers and merchants alike - regardless of where they live.

Integrated Merchant & User Support

At Electra we understand that the idea of managing a digital wallet and using digital currencies may be a little daunting for some. We are integrating a community support system into the Electra family of products. Regardless of where you are located around the world, there will be someone from the 10,000 plus member community that will be able to provide you with support and assistance using the Electra Payments Gateway and other Electra products and services.

## 
ElectraPay

ElectraPay is a community driven payment solution for merchants. The codebase consists of a centralized payment facility connected to plugins available for most e-commerce platforms (Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify, etc.).

The ElectraPay system allows merchants to receive payments for their goods and services by easily installing the plugin to their e-commerce websites. Customers will then be able to select ECA as a payment method. The plugin will convert the fiat value to ECA using the latest official ECA price as drawn from multiple exchanges. The customer is then shown a payment address along with a QR code. 

When the ElectraPay system detects initiation of a payment, it sends a validation call to the merchant’s website and routes the ECA through the ElectraPay system to obfuscate the final payment address. Merchants using this plugin can be confident that their transactions and wallets are secure and concealed from the customer. 


Merchants will easily be able to install the ElectraPay plugin to their online stores and the plugin is fully customizable to suit the merchant’s needs. Merchants wanting to use custom code in their own payment page will be able to do so with the open ElectraPay API.

Below is a chart showing the various building blocks of the ElectraPay system.

SocialPay

SocialPay by Electra is an automated application that enables individuals and organizations to leverage the power of Social Media. This is accomplished by initiating ECA transactions on a large scale, allowing content providers and organizations to send or receive ECA from their existing Social Media audiences. 

Electra’s Social Pay application is currently integrated with the platforms of Twitter, Telegram, Discord and Slack. As development of this service continues additional Social Media platforms will be added to include Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, Weibo, and others.

Who Is SocialPay For?

The current version of SocialPay is designed for communities who would like to send or receive ECA using their favorite Social Media platform. SocialPay allows users to send and receive ECA by simply posting a message to their Social Media account. This message can be either public or private.

Possible scenarios where SocialPay could be used include but are not limited to the following.

* Content creators and non-profit organizations accepting donations

* Rewards-based community building

* Crowdfunding

* Participation in ICO or Token Sales

Provided below is an example of how SocialPay may be used.

* The Red Cross is responding to an emergency situation and would like to raise funds to provide relief for those affected. By using the Electra SocialPay application and asking their followers for donations via Twitter, they can reach their entire audience within minutes. Once the application is set up, any Twitter user will be able to send an ECA donation via a direct message to the Red Cross. The Red Cross will then instantly receive the ECA within its account and be able to use the funds where they are most needed.

Future developments within Electra’s SocialPay application are aimed at expanding the possible field of Social Media participants.

**Atomic Swaps**

Why Atomic Swaps ?

Thousands of cryptocurrencies are currently in existence and the number continues to grow exponentially as blockchain technology is adopted.  It remains a complex task to exchange one cryptocurrency for another when payment needs require different currencies. Cryptocurrency transactions are currently not reversible. This requires the use of a trusted third party to ensure that both sides of a transaction are resolved, so exchanges are used to accomplish the trading of different cryptocurrencies. The Electra community understands the need to fill this void. Atomic Swaps is the answer.

![image alt text](image_0.png)

Electra’s atomic swap architecture generates a hash-time-locked contract, which uses multi-signature addresses and time locks to secure the transaction at an agreed upon price.

In a two party cryptocurrency transaction using atomic swap transactions on differing blockchains can occur simultaneously and are secured by the sharing of a private code between both parties. Use of the private code by one party will only complete the transaction if the second party also uses the same private code. Failure by one party to send the agreed upon amount of currency or to enter the correct code results in cancellation of the transaction and the return of all funds to their original location. This removes the need for trusted third party intervention.

For example, if a consumer wanted to use ECA to pay for pizza at a restaurant that accepts only Bitcoin, a complex series of operations must take place as illustrated below.

* Access an exchange

* Send ECA to that exchange

* Sell ECA for Bitcoin

* Open a Bitcoin wallet application

* Transfer Bitcoin to that wallet from the exchange

* Wait for the Bitcoin transaction to confirm

* Pay for your (cold) pizza

It is easy to see why the process is not currently used in commercial interactions at the retail level.

 Applying Atomic Swaps

The following is a list of operations that would be required when employing Atomic Swap technology for the same transaction: paying for pizza with ECA at an establishment that accepts only Bitcoin.

* Open your Electra application

* Scan the Bitcoin QRCode

* Confirm the payment within the application

Atomic Swap technology greatly reduces the complexity of the transaction between customer and merchant by removing the necessity of knowing which cryptocurrency is accepted at a given location. Both the non-ECA blockchain and the ECA blockchain confirm the transaction. If either blockchain rejects the transaction ECA is returned to the customer’s wallet.

## Master Nodes

# Master Node implementation is an essential part of the ECA development process. Implementing Master Nodes on the ECA network will provide the following main benefits:

*  Faster Transactions on the ECA Network

*  Increased Privacy of Transactions

*  Improved Health and Stability of the ECA Network

*  Improved Decentralization of the ECA Ecosystem

To initiate and run a Master Node, Electra community members apply to the core development team to obtain Node specifications and requirements. Development of Master Nodes on the ECA network is ongoing. Refer to the most recent version of the roadmap for target release dates.

## Web Wallet

# Not all users want to install a desktop or mobile wallet. Electra’s Web Wallet offers an online solution that provides users the same functions. The following main development blocks have been identified:

* Wallet Subsystem

* ECA Core

* Web Frontend

* Mobile Extension Interface (Optional)

The Mobile Extension Interface (MEI) allows the end user to access their web wallet from a personal device. The MEI integrates with other 3rd party applications (Whatsapp, Telegram, address book) allowing the user to employ the Electra SocialPay service to send ECA via Social Media.
