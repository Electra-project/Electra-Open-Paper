# Electra White Paper - The Open Paper

30 January 2018

### Abstract

Electra is an open-source, community-driven cryptocurrency project featuring the hallmark decentralized and distributed governance of blockchain technologies. Electra's foundation is based on NIST5 encryption algorithms and Proof-of-Stake (POS) transaction authentication, guaranteeing fast and secure transactions with nearly non-existent transaction fees.

Electra is unique in that its development is lead by a core team, but contracted out to talented and passionate Electra Community members. At present, Electra is a fully functioning cryptocurrency. There is no ICO, no smoke, no mirrors, simply a highly efficient, dynamic coin supported by some highly capable people.

The Electra Blockchain is a product of the combined skills and abilities of our ever-growing community of coders, developers, and business professionals. These individuals have built a solid foundation for the community to build upon. All contributions and updates are openly available to read through by the community to ensure maximum stability and security. Too many cooks might spoil a stew, but a thousand critics can't be wrong.

The Electra Project aims to continue the cryptographic legacy laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, utilizing the technology and wisdom we have accumulated in the past nine years. We are not aiming to replace the world's financial system, but rather we are seeking to make it work better. Today's technology runs circles around that which backs the fiat currency system; this is not a secret, as many major financial institutions are beginning to incorporate private blockchain technology into their systems. While this is beneficial to the bankers and international business people, most people will see no benefit from it in their day-to-day life. The Electra Project hopes to bring the benefits of blockchain technology to the everyday person by providing to them a consistently seamless transaction experience from the moment they first open the app.

# Electrifying the Cryptocurrency Community

Electra is more than a common digital currency. It is a currency backed by an entire community of dedicated individuals. Electra’s goal is to create the strongest possible community of individuals who all share the same philosophy of change with regards to global monetary systems. Through transparency and empowerment, we are shining a new light on a darkening system. This is not a zero sum game; this is Electra.

Our vision for Electra is that it becomes the largest and most active cryptocurrency community within the market space. An active global community provides investors an opportunity to assume roles as active players and contributors. Electra is not only a decentralized organization, but a unique and powerful revolution based on shared ownership and collaboration among the skilled experts throughout our community.

## Investor Benefit

ECA investors hold a stake in the Electra organization and are encouraged to become directly involved in the development process. All investors are owners of both the cryptocurrency and the entire structure that exists behind the project.

## Innovative and Open Development Process

The underlying architecture of the Electra Project is continuously subjected to multiple stages of validation. Through this process only the most valid and valuable changes are adopted and integrated. Any and all decisions are subject to review, update, and upgrade as needed. Even an optimal system has limits. Guarantees of reversibility and the highest level of quality are needed. Electra’s strength is its ability to adapt and consistently meet the needs of a changing global environment.

Building and deconstructing simultaneously is necessary to create the best possible product given the current limitations, and at the same time provide for the ability to further refine the product. In doing so we must accept the possibility that the existing product has room to improve or that the underlying factors of previous developments have changed. Our methodology allows for continuous evolution of the product within a changing environment. The resulting development will produce the best possible product at any given time.

## Electra Sets New Standards for Cryptocurrencies

The best product is the one capable of becoming completely different from its origins. Today, the leading cryptocurrencies on the market can only guarantee their relevance to investors for an ephemeral period. What is now at the forefront of the market will soon be outdated and outclassed by innovative competitors.

As a community we synthesize and condense the vision of many individuals, compare and contrast diverse viewpoints, and examine possible outcomes. The results of this process are subjected to rigorous review, which allows us to systematically detect probable errors by analyzing a multitude of viewpoints. This approach ensures that only the most valid ideas survive to reach implementation. To reach our goals it is necessary to widen the scope of discussion as much as possible and to extend an open dialogue indefinitely. 

The end result is the Electra Project.

The Electra Project’s primary points of focus are the following:

* Design and build the most cutting edge cryptocurrency

* Create a financial ecosystem for the community

* Ensure that the project is driven by community needs

* Evolve the product over time, utilizing best practices

# Current Technology

## The Algorithm

ECA is built using an algorithm that guarantees security; NIST5. NIST5  is an algorithm developed using the best features of the five SHA-3 finalist algorithms as selected by the National Institute of Science and Technology of America. In practice, the NIST5 algorithm as implemented in ECA selects the most beneficial attributes of each component algorithm to maximize performance, security, and efficiency. These component algorithms include:

* BLAKE

* Grostl

* JH

* Keccak

* Skein

** NIST Competition Summary   [http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf)    

** Handbook of Digital Currency Bitcoin Innovation, Financial Instruments and Big Data.pdf

## The Electra Blockchain

The underlying blockchain of the ECA coin utilizes a modified version of the NIST5 algorithm with the following properties:* *

* Block Size: 1MB

* Block Time: 5 minutes (288 blocks per day)

* Max Supply: 30,000,000,000

* Pre-mined: 1,000,000,019 (approximately 3.34%)

* Difficulty Target: Retarget occurs every 15 minutes (every 3 blocks)

* Fee: 0.00001 ECA


## Purpose and Use of Pre-mined ECA

1,000,000,019 (approximately 3.34%) ECA were pre-mined using Proof of Work (PoW) mining. Pre-mined funds are maintained by a trusted Community Funds Manager. Distribution and use of funds is determined by community consensus. Pre-mined funds will be used for various purposes including but not limited to the following:

* Maintaining the security and usability of the platform

* Funding further development projects as outlined by Electra Roadmap

* Application to new exchanges

## Fast Payments

ECA transactions are received in the recipient’s wallet almost instantly and the ECA received is spendable as soon as the transaction is confirmed in the blockchain. The confirmation process requires less than five minutes.

## Transaction Fees Approaching Zero

With transaction fees on the Electra network of 0.00001 ECA, it takes 100,000 transactions to accumulate one ECA worth of transaction fees (approximately $0.004 USD at time of this publication). This results in a cost per transaction of approximately $0.00000004.

## Staking Rewards

ECA features a 50% annual stake reward rate. There is no fixed reward per block. Each stake reward is proportional to the amount staked relative to the total ECA in circulation. Additional information regarding the Proof of Stake reward structure for ECA can be found at: 

* https://electraproject.org/crypto-wallet-staking-guide-electra-project

## Optional Privacy

Future developments within the Electra ecosystem will allow for the use of privacy gateways, including but not limited to the following.

* TOR

* IP2 networks 

* Kovri

Users will be able to select the privacy functions best suited to their individual needs. The Electra community is continually working to identify the most scalable and efficient gateway configurations to ensure privacy of transactions. 

## Environmentally Friendly

The NIST5 algorithm utilized by the ECA cryptocurrency is more environmentally friendly than competing technologies and has proven to be a sustainable option for deployment of blockchain-based systems. NIST5 requires significantly less energy to run than competing algorithms without compromising the security of network members. 

Furthermore, Electra does not have an extended Proof of Work (PoW) phase. Electra’s blockchain network is now Proof of Stake (PoS) which results in no miners and a greatly reduced carbon footprint.

# Future Technology

When you invest in ECA you become a stakeholder in a fully open source project aimed at developing the most cutting edge technology for the evolution of cryptocurrency. Investors who choose Electra will be a part of this journey. Current technology is a good starting point. However, creating the cryptocurrency of the future requires going beyond the limits of existing technology. 

The strength of ECA resides in the contract that guarantees investors full participation in the direction of the project, including all future developments and technologies. ECA’s potential growth is guaranteed because tomorrow's ECA will not be just another coin, but rather an adaptation to future societal and economic needs. Investors can be confident that when they purchase ECA, they are investing in the present and future growth of a unique cryptocurrency ecosystem.

If an algorithm emerges that is more efficient and superior to NIST5, Electra’s development team is prepared to adapt ECA's underlying structure to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. As Electra grows the block time can be reduced and the block size can be increased. The adaptability of ECA allows for the blockchain to be maintained while the algorithm is rewritten from scratch. In effect Electra is a blank paper for writing revolutionary code. Writing the code of the future on an already active codebase results in a deployed structure that neither obstructs, limits, nor hinders future development. ECA’s architecture allows a subsequent structure to intersect, connect, flank or replace the existing structure. Electra provides a better solution than existing currencies can and guarantees the community full control.

# Electra Ecosystem

In order for merchants to complete transactions, they need to be able to accept payments from consumers. In today’s world merchants do not have the proper technical tools at their disposal for accepting digital currency as a form of payment. Merchants that do accept digital currencies  are paying extremely high fees to do so.

Despite the proliferation of technology across the globe, many developing regions of the world continue to operate within a system where the ‘Cash is King’ philosophy remains dominant in conducting commerce. Ease of adoption provided by the Electra ecosystem combined with easy access to mobile Internet in developing countries provides a secure, fast, and low fee payment gateway for both consumers and merchants alike - regardless of where they live.

## The Electra Family of Products

Electra’s family of products can be summarized into the following categories. Each product will be described in greater detail below.

* Desktop Wallets  (Windows, Linux, Mac)

* Mobile Wallets (iOS & Android) 

* Web Wallet

* Merchant Applications

    * Plugins for eCommerce Applications

    * Merchant Mobile Applications

    * Merchant Desktop Software

    * Centralized Online Payment Gateway

Each product will be available to any person who has a need to make quick and secure transactions with low fees. The development of wallets, applications and software are driven by the community. Each product will include an integrated support framework, containing user guides and live support from the community.

## Electra Services

The following services will be provided across all products offered by Electra: 

* Integrated Merchant & User Support

* ElectraPay

* SocialPay

* Atomic Swaps

## ElectraPay

ElectraPay is a community driven payment solution for merchants. The codebase consists of a centralized payment facility connected to plugins available for most e-commerce platforms (Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify, etc.).

The ElectraPay system allows merchants to receive payments for their goods and services by easily installing the plugin to their e-commerce websites. Customers will then be able to select ECA as a payment method. The plugin will convert the fiat value to ECA using the latest official ECA price as drawn from multiple exchanges. The customer is then shown a payment address along with a QR code. 

When the ElectraPay system detects initiation of a payment, it sends a validation call to the merchant’s website and routes the ECA through the ElectraPay system to obfuscate the final payment address. Merchants using this plugin can be confident that their transactions and wallets are secure and concealed from the customer. 

Merchants will easily be able to install the ElectraPay plugin to their online stores and the plugin is fully customizable to suit the merchant’s needs. Merchants wanting to use custom code in their own payment page will be able to do so with the open ElectraPay API.

Below is a chart showing the various building blocks of the ElectraPay system.

## SocialPay

SocialPay by Electra is an automated application that enables individuals and organizations to leverage the power of Social Media. This is accomplished by initiating ECA transactions on a large scale, allowing content providers and organizations to send or receive ECA from their existing Social Media audiences. 

Electra’s Social Pay application is currently integrated with the platforms of Twitter, Telegram, Discord and Slack. As development of this service continues additional Social Media platforms will be added to include Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, Weibo, and others.

### Who Is SocialPay For?

The current version of SocialPay is designed for communities who would like to send or receive ECA using their favorite Social Media platform. SocialPay allows users to send and receive ECA by simply posting a message to their Social Media account. This message can be either public or private.

Possible scenarios where SocialPay could be used include but are not limited to the following.

* Content creators and non-profit organizations accepting donations

* Rewards-based community building

* Crowdfunding

* Participation in ICO or Token Sales

Provided below is an example of how SocialPay may be used.

* The Red Cross is responding to an emergency situation and would like to raise funds to provide relief for those affected. By using the Electra SocialPay application and asking their followers for donations via Twitter, they can reach their entire audience within minutes. Once the application is set up, any Twitter user will be able to send an ECA donation via a direct message to the Red Cross. The Red Cross will then instantly receive the ECA within its account and be able to use the funds where they are most needed.

Future developments within Electra’s SocialPay application are aimed at expanding the possible field of Social Media participants.

## Atomic Swaps

Why Atomic Swaps ?

Thousands of cryptocurrencies are currently in existence and the number continues to grow exponentially as blockchain technology is adopted.  It remains a complex task to exchange one cryptocurrency for another when payment needs require different currencies. Cryptocurrency transactions are currently not reversible. This requires the use of a trusted third party to ensure that both sides of a transaction are resolved, so exchanges are used to accomplish the trading of different cryptocurrencies. The Electra community understands the need to fill this void. Atomic Swaps is the answer.

![image alt text](images/image_0.png)

Electra’s atomic swap architecture generates a hash-time-locked contract, which uses multi-signature addresses and time locks to secure the transaction at an agreed upon price.

In a two party cryptocurrency transaction using atomic swap transactions on differing blockchains can occur simultaneously and are secured by the sharing of a private code between both parties. Use of the private code by one party will only complete the transaction if the second party also uses the same private code. Failure by one party to send the agreed upon amount of currency or to enter the correct code results in cancellation of the transaction and the return of all funds to their original location. This removes the need for trusted third party intervention.

For example, if a consumer wanted to use ECA to pay for pizza at a restaurant that accepts only Bitcoin, a complex series of operations must take place as illustrated below.

* Access an exchange

* Send ECA to that exchange

* Sell ECA for Bitcoin

* Open a Bitcoin wallet application

* Transfer Bitcoin to that wallet from the exchange

* Wait for the Bitcoin transaction to confirm

* Pay for your (cold) pizza

It is easy to see why the process is not currently used in commercial interactions at the retail level.

### Applying Atomic Swaps

The following is a list of operations that would be required when employing Atomic Swap technology for the same transaction: paying for pizza with ECA at an establishment that accepts only Bitcoin.

* Open your Electra application

* Scan the Bitcoin QRCode

* Confirm the payment within the application

Atomic Swap technology greatly reduces the complexity of the transaction between customer and merchant by removing the necessity of knowing which cryptocurrency is accepted at a given location. Both the non-ECA blockchain and the ECA blockchain confirm the transaction. If either blockchain rejects the transaction ECA is returned to the customer’s wallet.

## Master Nodes

# Master Node implementation is an essential part of the ECA development process. Implementing Master Nodes on the ECA network will provide the following main benefits:

*  Faster Transactions on the ECA Network

*  Increased Privacy of Transactions

*  Improved Health and Stability of the ECA Network

*  Improved Decentralization of the ECA Ecosystem

To initiate and run a Master Node, Electra community members apply to the core development team to obtain Node specifications and requirements. Development of Master Nodes on the ECA network is ongoing. Refer to the most recent version of the roadmap for target release dates.

## Web Wallet

# Not all users want to install a desktop or mobile wallet. Electra’s Web Wallet offers an online solution that provides users the same functions. The following main development blocks have been identified:

* Wallet Subsystem

* ECA Core

* Web Frontend

* Mobile Extension Interface (Optional)

The Mobile Extension Interface (MEI) allows the end user to access their web wallet from a personal device. The MEI integrates with other 3rd party applications (Whatsapp, Telegram, address book) allowing the user to employ the Electra SocialPay service to send ECA via Social Media.

# Founder’s Vision

*The main goals I had when creating Electra was for it to be able to remain active indefinitely and easy to use. A key component to achieve these goals is an active community. In less than a year, the community has progressed immensely and is a completely self-governing entity that can act without my interference. The whitepaper itself is written by the community which may be a first in the blockchain sector. The current parameters of Electra take into account security, privacy, speed and efficiency. It is a solid template to build upon.*

*The new community roadmap is ambitious and aims to make Electra a premier cryptocurrency. For these goals, as well as my own, the development team has been expanded and will also eventually become self-governing. Just as I have done so far, I will aid Electra’s expansion and provide funding when necessary for future endeavours.* Electra01
